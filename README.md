YouTube Data API - [LINK](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)

## Aims & Objectives
1.Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.<br>
2.Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example:<br>
  -Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?<br>
  -Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?<br>
  -Does title length matter for views?<br>
  -How many tags do good performing videos have? What are the common tags among these videos?<br>
  -Across all the creators I take into consideration, how often do they upload new videos? On which days in the week?<br>
3.Explore the trending topics using NLP techniques<br>
  -Which popular topics are being covered in the videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)?<br>
  -Which questions are being asked in the comment sections in the videos,<br>
